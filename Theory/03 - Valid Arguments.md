# Arguments and their Validity
In mathematics and logic an argument is not a dispute. It is simply a **sequence of statements ending in a conclusion**. In this section we show how to determine whether an argument is valid—that is, whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the preceding
statements

## Arguments and Argument Forms 
> An argument is a sequence of statements, and an argument form is a sequence
> of statement forms. 

We can divide them in two parts
* All statements in an argument and all statement forms in an argument form, except for the final one, are called **premises** (or assumptions or hypotheses)
* The final statement or statement form is called the **conclusion**. 
  * The symbol $\therefore$, which is read “therefore,” is normally placed just before the conclusion.

```math
\text{if p then q}
\\
p
\\
\therefore q
```


### Valid Arguments and Valid Argument Forms 
> To say that an argument form is valid means that no matter what particular
> statements are substituted for the statement variables in its premises, if the resulting
> premises are all true, then the conclusion is also true. To say that an argument is
> valid means that its form is valid

## Deduction or Modus Ponens 
It is a type of syllogism which implies reasoning of the form "if $p$ is true and $p \Rightarrow q$ is true, then $q$ is true"
