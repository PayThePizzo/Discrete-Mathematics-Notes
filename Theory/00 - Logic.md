# Logic
Logic focuses on propositions (or statements) which can be
either **TRUE** or **FALSE** (truth values)

--- 

## Statements or Propositions
> A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is true or false but not both.

| **Priority** | **Symbol**            | **Name**      | **Known As**    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| _1_          | $\urcorner$ or $\sim$ | Negation      | NOT             |
| _2_          | $\wedge$              | Conjunction   | AND             |
| _3_          | $\vee$                | Disjunction   | OR              |
| _4_          | $\Rightarrow$         | Conditional   | IF..THEN..      |
| _5_          | $\Longleftrightarrow$ | Biconditional | IF AND ONLY IF  |

### NOT
> If $p$ is a statement variable, the negation of $p$ is “not $p$” or “It is not the case that $p$”
> and is denoted $\urcorner p$. It has opposite truth value from $p$: if $p$ is true, $\urcorner p$ is false; if $p$ is
> false, $\urcorner p$ is true.

| $p$ | $\urcorner p$ |
|-----|---------------|
|  T  |       F       |
|  F  |       T       |


### AND
> If $p$ and $q$ are statement variables, the conjunction of $p$ and $q$ is “p and q,” denoted 
> $p \wedge q$. It is true when, and only when, both $p$ and $q$ are true. If either $p$ or $q$ is false, 
> or if both are false, $p \wedge q$ is false.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \wedge q$ |
|-----|-----|--------------|
|  T  |  T  |       T      |
|  T  |  F  |       F      |
|  F  |  T  |       F      |
|  F  |  F  |       F      |


### OR
> If $p$ and $q$ are statement variables, the disjunction of $p$ and $q$ is “p or q,” denoted
> $p \vee q$. It is true when either $p$ is true, or $q$ is true, or both $p$ and $q$ are true; it is false
> only when both $p$ and $q$ are false.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \vee q$ |
|-----|-----|------------|
|  T  |  T  |      T     |
|  T  |  F  |      T     |
|  F  |  T  |      T     |
|  F  |  F  |      F     |


### IF THEN


### IFF

## Compound Statements - Logical Connectors
> A statement form (or propositional form) is an expression made up of statement
> variables (such as p, q, and r) and logical connectives (such as $\thicksim$, $\wedge$, and $\vee$) that
> becomes a statement when actual statements are substituted for the component statement
> variables. The truth table for a given statement form displays the truth values
> that correspond to all possible combinations of truth values for its component statement variables.
