# Logic
Logic focuses on propositions (or statements) which can be
either **TRUE** or **FALSE**

--- 

## Statements or Propositions
> A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is true or false but not both.

## Logical connectors - Order by priority

| **Priority** | **Symbol**            | **Name**      | **Known As**    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| _1_          | $\urcorner$ or $\sim$ | Negation      | NOT             |
| _2_          | $\wedge$              | Conjunction   | AND             |
| _3_          | $\vee$                | Disjunction   | OR              |
| _4_          | $\Rightarrow$         | Conditional   | IF..THEN..      |
| _5_          | $\Longleftrightarrow$ | Biconditional | IF AND ONLY IF  |
| _Extra_      | $\bigoplus$           | XOR           | Exclusive OR    |

## Compound statements 
> A statement form (or propositional form) is an expression made up of statement
> variables (such as p, q, and r) and logical connectives (such as $\thicksim$, $\wedge$, and $\vee$) that
> becomes a statement when actual statements are substituted for the component statement
> variables. The truth table for a given statement form displays the truth values
> that correspond to all possible combinations of truth values for its component statement variables.
