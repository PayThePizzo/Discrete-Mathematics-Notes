# Logic
Logic focuses on propositions (or statements) which can be
either **TRUE** or **FALSE** (truth values)

--- 

## Variable
> A variable is a mathematical object used as a placeholder

Usually indicated as $x, y, \ldots$

### Propositional Variables
> Variable used to indicate a proposition

Usually indicated as $p, q, r, t$ (tautologies) $, c$ (contradictions) $, \ldots$

---

## Statements or Propositions
> A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is true or false but not both.

### Statement Forms or Propositional Forms
> A statement form (or propositional form) is an expression made up of statement
> variables (such as p, q, and r) and logical connectives (such as $\thicksim$, $\wedge$, and $\vee$) that
> becomes a statement when actual statements are substituted for the component statement
> variables. The truth table for a given statement form displays the truth values
> that correspond to all possible combinations of truth values for its component statement variables.
