### Warning
I take no credit from any of the material that is included, nor I assure the correctness of my notes since I am not a professor. 

All the material cited is intended for personal use and I highly recommend purchasing 
the textbooks cited.

Please contact me as soon as possible, if you feel like:
1. Your work has not been cited correctly, or you want me to remove it
2. There are some errors I should correct, or unclear sections.

PS: Sorry but some parts are in italian as i was trying to jot down as much as I could.
